# Transfer Learining using ResNet-18
Image Classification using transfer learning as detailed by Sasank Chilamkurthy   
in the pytorch tutorial on transfer learning   as found at 
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html

# Celebrity Classifier
Instead of using the default data set used in the tutorial I decided to make a
machine classifier that would determing whether the image was either jennifer lopez
or kim kardashian or just a  random celebrity.
